# Arduboy-Says

This is a Simon Says clone using the D-Pad.
You get 3 lives and 1 point per correct answer.  The game has a total of 20 levels, which will require memorising a 2 (level 1) to 22 (level 20) directional sequence.

The game uses a semi random generator to provide a different game play each time. This does need tweaking as often the same sequences repeat when playing the same levels over.

Good luck and I hope you enjoy playing.
